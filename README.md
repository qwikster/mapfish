## what is it?
A fast and easy to use CLI weather app with super neat map view!\
Should work on basically everything, as long as you have Python and Internet access.\
(a note: flakeframe was known as Mapfish before submitting!)

## usage and installation
`pip install flakeframe`, or `pipx` if you're on an externally managed system like Arch (btw).

Then just pick a location (coordinates or an address/place) and run `flakeframe`!

## controls
Use WASD/arrow keys to navigate in the main menu, then +/- to change zoom levels.\
Q to go back to the main menu, R to refresh your weather data.
